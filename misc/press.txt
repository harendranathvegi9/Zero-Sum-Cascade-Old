Hello, I am Connor Shearwood, artist, programmer and writer for the Ministry of
Plenty, a newly formed collaboration between myself and Ryan Wilkinson. Together,
we are working on an isometric psychological horror game called "Zero Sum
Cascade". Before we go any further, please be warned that the game deals with
themes of death, destruction and genocide, just to mention a few. As such, it is
not suitable for a younger audience.
 
Zero Sum Cascade engrosses the player in what at first sight appears a ‘normal’
world, a world lulled into an arrogant sense of security wrought out of an
increasing self-importance: a world oblivious to those who truly lie beyond the
great rift of reality. An unexplainable, remarkable phenomenon, the Zero Sum
Cascade is a being transcendent of mankind, and our pithy attempts at
understanding the cosmos. Corroding all that it touches, and rendering our
scientific laws asunder, protagonist Roel Danielson is but one of many of the
ZSC’s tormented victims. The ZSC is a warped embodiment of neither good nor
evil, but is instead a begetter of chaos, an eternal meanderer of the
multiverse, and the greatest threat imaginable to mankind. 
 
You, as Roel, must choose your path through this twisted world. Action-reaction
is stretched to the illogical limit as you lose your grip on reality.
Alternatively moving and disturbing, Zero Sum Cascade is a roller-coaster ride
through either the fall of humankind or the dawn of a new age.
 
Follow the development of the game at the http://zsc.lifein2d.co.uk/ . We look
forward to discussing the finer points of insanity with you.
