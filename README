Zero Sum Cascade is an Open Source 2.5D Isometric Cross Platform Psychological Horror game built on top of the FIFE engine.

Zero Sum Cascade engrosses the player in what at first sight appears a ‘normal’ world, a world lulled into an arrogant sense of security wrought out of an increasing self-importance: a world oblivious to those who truly lie beyond the great rift of reality. An unexplainable, remarkable phenomenon, the Zero Sum Cascade is a being transcendent of mankind, and our pithy attempts at understanding the cosmos. Corroding all that it touches, and rendering our scientific laws asunder, protagonist Roel Danielson is but one of many of the ZSC’s tormented victims. The ZSC is a warped embodiment of neither good nor evil, but is instead a begetter of chaos, an eternal meanderer of the multiverse, and the greatest threat imaginable to mankind. 

You, as Roel, must choose your path through this twisted world. Action-reaction is stretched to the illogical limit as you lose your grip on reality. Alternatively moving and disturbing, Zero Sum Cascade is a roller-coaster ride through either the fall of humankind or the dawn of a new age.
